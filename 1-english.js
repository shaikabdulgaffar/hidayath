            <h3>Our Belief About Allah Almighty</h3>
            <p>Allah is One, He has no partner, nothing is like Him. No one except Him is worthy of worship. He always existed and will always exist, He is alive, He sustains everything. All creation has been created by Him. He was not created by anyone, He has no wife, no children, no relatives. He does whatever He wills, no one can stop Him. He provides sustenance to all, He causes death, He gives life, He has power over everything. Allah Almighty is very merciful; to lose hope in His mercy is disbelief. He possesses great strength and power. His grasp is very severe; to become fearless of Him means one does not remain a Muslim.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)</h3>
            <p>He is Allah Almighty's special servant, beloved, and the final Messenger (ﷺ). No new Prophet will come after him, and anyone who claims prophethood after him is a deceiver and a liar. After Allah, he is the most superior and revered among all creation. He was sent as a Prophet for all humans and jinn. All the Prophets who came before him were also truthful and sent by Allah, but now, until the Day of Judgment, obedience is only to our Prophet (ﷺ). Allah Almighty took him, alive in body and soul, in a single night from Makkah to Baitul Muqaddas, then to the seven heavens and as far as willed, and showed him Paradise and Hell. This is called Mi'raj. We believe in it exactly as it happened. Allah Almighty manifested miracles through him which could not happen for others; these are called 'Mu'jizaat' (miracles).</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About the Holy Qur'an</h3>
            <p>The Holy Qur'an is the Word of Allah Almighty. Allah revealed it to our Prophet (ﷺ) through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). Besides this, the Torah, Psalms (Zaboor), Gospel (Injeel), the scriptures of Moses and Abraham, and all other books sent from the sky are all true, but until the Day of Judgment, practice is only upon the Holy Qur'an.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About Angels</h3>
            <p>Allah Almighty created a creation from light called angels. He has assigned them different duties, but they are hidden from our eyes and never disobey Allah in the slightest. Another creation, made from fire, is called jinn; they are also hidden from our sight. Among them are good and bad, Muslim and non-Muslim, male and female, and they have offspring.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About Destiny (Taqdeer)</h3>
            <p>Allah Almighty has predetermined everything about every human before their creation; this is called "Taqdeer" (Destiny). Its true nature is known only to Allah. Human deeds have no influence in destiny and divine decree; no one can change or delay it. Our belief is that whatever good or bad comes to us, it was certainly destined for us, no matter what, and whatever we did not get will never be ours, no matter what is done. Reflecting too deeply on the reality of destiny is not our ability, so we have a general faith in it and do not give room for doubts or misgivings.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About the Companions (Sahaabah, may Allah be pleased with them)</h3>
            <p>All of them were true, devoted, and obedient companions of the Prophet (ﷺ). They followed and obeyed him in every way and set an exemplary path of love and devotion. Allah Almighty and His Messenger (ﷺ) are pleased with them. Therefore, we consider love for them a part of faith, regard their enemies as our enemies, accept their unity, and leave their differences to Allah. Allah Almighty, knowing everything about them, has declared His pleasure for them in the Qur'an. Among the Companions, the most superior are the ten promised Paradise, and among them, the highest rank is for the Rightly Guided Caliphs, with Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) foremost, then Umar, then Uthman, then Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all). To criticize or speak ill of any Companion is a grave sin.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About the Followers, Saints, Jurists, and Pious Predecessors</h3>
            <p>All were friends of Allah Almighty and sincerely worked for the religion. We trust their religious researches and integrity. If any of their statements contradict the Shariah, we do not accept it, but we interpret it in the best way or consider them excused. Their status is less than that of Prophets and Companions, but we believe in their miracles.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Belief About the Day of Judgment and Its Signs</h3>
            <p>The coming of the Day of Judgment is certain. The coming of angels, the taking of the soul, the arrival of Munkar and Nakir, questioning, resurrection after death, appearing before Allah, reckoning, weighing of deeds, crossing the bridge (Pul Siraat), Paradise and all its blessings, Hell and all its torments and punishments, seeing Allah, and everything the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) has informed us about - we accept and believe in all of it as he conveyed. Similarly, the news that the grave will either be a pit of Hell or a garden of Paradise is true. Also, the signs of the Day of Judgment such as the appearance of Dajjal, the coming of Jesus (peace be upon him), the appearance of Gog and Magog (Ya'juj Ma'juj), the rising of the sun from the west, and every sign reported—all are true.</p>

            <h3>Who is a Prophet?</h3>

            <h3>What is Riwayat?</h3>

            <h3>What is the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah)?</h3>

            <li><strong>Wajib (Necessary):</strong> That which is established by less absolute proof; denying it does not make one a disbeliever, but leaving it without excuse is sinful and deserving of punishment.</li>

                <li>If after ghusl one remembers a dry spot, just washing that place is sufficient, no need to repeat ghusl.</li>
                <li>If any part remains dry, or mouth/nostrils weren't washed, and one performed prayer, then after remembering, complete the missed act of ghusl and repeat the prayer.</li>

                <li>If ointment is applied to cracked hands/feet due to cold, pouring water over it suffices. If a bandage is present, wiping a wet hand over it is enough if pouring water on it is harmful; otherwise, water must reach it.</li>

            <h3>When Is Tayammum Permitted?</h3>
            <p>
                When water is not found within a mile's distance according to your best estimate, or there is fear of enemy, thief, robber, or illness which may worsen by using water (according to your dominant assumption), or a qualified doctor prohibits it, then tayammum is permitted.
            </p>

            <h3>On What Can Tayammum Be Performed?</h3>
            <p>
                On pure earth, sand, stone, lime, unglazed or glazed clay pots that are not painted, unbaked or baked bricks, earth, bricks, stone, lime walls, and clean dust.
            </p>

            <h3>Obligations of Tayammum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Making intention</li>
                <li>Striking both hands on earth and wiping the face</li>
                <li>Striking both hands on earth and wiping both hands including the elbows</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Breaks Tayammum?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Everything that breaks wudu also breaks tayammum</li>
                <li>Tayammum for major impurity breaks only by that impurity</li>
                <li>Tayammum also breaks when water becomes available</li>
                <li>If tayammum was due to illness, it breaks when the excuse is gone</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Issues of Tayammum</h3>
            <p>
                One tayammum lasts for as many prayers as needed until it breaks. Tayammum made for obligatory prayer is valid for obligatory, optional prayers, reciting the Qur'an, funeral prayer, prostration of recitation, and all worship. Tayammum remains valid as long as water is not found or the excuse continues. Even if years pass in such a state, there is no problem.

                <li>Take care to use miswaak; it has many benefits:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cleans the mouth</li>
                    <li>Produces fragrance</li>

                    <li>Removes phlegm</li>
                    <li>Removes yellow bile</li>
                    <li>Sharpens eyesight</li>
                    <li>Brings the pleasure of Allah</li>
                    <li>Is beloved to Allah</li>
                    <li>Is beloved to the angels</li>
                    <li>Angers Satan</li>
                    <li>Most importantly, it helps to recite the Kalimah at the time of death</li>
                    <li>Miswaak is the sunnah of the Prophets (peace be upon them)</li>
                    <li>Miswaak increases memory</li>
                    <li>It is a cure for every disease except death</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to Use Miswaak</h3>
            <p>
                It is narrated from Hazrat Abdullah bin Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the miswaak should be held so that the little finger and thumb are on the bottom side of the miswaak, and the remaining fingers are on top.
                While using miswaak, intend to purify your mouth for reciting Qur'an or mentioning Allah in prayer.
                The method is to first use it on the upper right teeth, then upper left, then lower right, and finally lower left.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Supplication for Miswaak</h3>
            <p>
                Allahumma tahhir fami wa nawwir qalbi wa tahhir badani wa harrim jasadi alan-naar.<br>
                اللَّهُمَّ طَهِّرْ فَمِي وَنَوِّرْ قَلْبِي وَطَهِّرْ بَدَنِي وَحَرِّمْ جَسَدِي عَلَى النَّارِ
            </p>
            
            <h3>Some Etiquette of Miswaak</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Chewing the miswaak sideways is disliked</li>
                <li>At first, the miswaak should be about a span long, not longer, as Satan rides on it</li>

                <li>If the miswaak dries, softening it with water is recommended</li>

For Qauma (standing after ruku), rise calmly and stand straight so all bones are settled in their joints. When you prostrate (sajdah), sit calmly. Likewise, perform every rak'ah's bowing, standing, prostration, and sitting with calmness.

        title: "Explanation and Rules of Sajda-e-Sahu (Prostration of Forgetfulness)",
        content: `
            <h3>Explanation of Sajda-e-Sahu</h3>
            <p>
                "Sahu" means forgetfulness. Sometimes, due to a mistake or excess/deficiency, a defect occurs in prayer. Some defects can be corrected by performing two prostrations after reciting Attahiyyaat in the last sitting of prayer, after turning the head to the right for Salaam; these are called Sajda-e-Sahu.
            </p>
            <p>
                The method of Sajda-e-Sahu is: After reciting Attahiyyaat in the final sitting, turn the head to the right for Salaam, say Takbeer and perform a prostration, recite the Tasbeeh three times, then rise with Takbeer and sit, again with Takbeer perform the second prostration, recite the Tasbeeh three times, then rise with Takbeer, sit, recite Attahiyyaat, Durood Shareef and Du'a, and then complete prayer with Salaam on both sides.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ruling of Sajda-e-Sahu is the same in all prayers. If both sides Salaam is given, according to one narration it is allowed, but the stronger narration is to not perform Sajda-e-Sahu, rather the prayer should be repeated.
            </p>

            <h3>Principles When Sajda-e-Sahu Becomes Necessary</h3>
            <p>Sajda-e-Sahu becomes necessary in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If any necessary act (wajib) is missed by mistake, e.g., the first sitting is omitted</li>
                <li>If a wajib is delayed from its proper place, e.g., reciting another Surah before Surah Al-Fatiha</li>
                <li>If a wajib is delayed by the duration of a pillar (rukn) due to forgetfulness</li>
                <li>If a wajib is performed twice by mistake</li>
                <li>If a wajib is changed by mistake</li>
                <li>If any obligatory act (farz) is delayed from its place</li>
                <li>If a farz is performed before its proper time</li>
                <li>If a farz is performed twice by mistake</li>

            <h3>Method of Qasar Prayer</h3>
            <p>
                According to Imam-e-Azam Abu Hanifa (ra), a traveler is one who undertakes a journey of 3 stages (according to English miles, 48 miles, approximately 88 kilometers), and whose stay at that place is less than 15 days. If the intention is to stay for more than fifteen days, then he is not considered a traveler, but a resident, and must offer full prayers. If the journey is less than 48 miles, he is not a traveler and must offer full prayers.
            </p>
            <p>
                During travel, Qasar (shortened prayer) applies only to Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha prayers. That is, four rak'ah prayers are performed as half (two rak'ahs). Fajr and Maghrib remain the same, Witr is obligatory and must be performed as three rak'ahs. Sunnah prayers, except for Fajr, are optional; the two rak'ahs of Sunnah for Fajr must be performed. For other prayers' Sunnahs, if there is time and ease, they should be performed, otherwise only the obligatory (fard) is enough. It is necessary for the traveler (according to Hanafi school) to perform Qasar in prayer.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How Much Is the Travel Distance?</h3>
            <p>
                In kilometers: 87 kilometers 782 meters 40 centimeters, which is approximately 88 kilometers (Modern Fiqhi Issues, Deoband).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Issues of Qasar Prayer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone who does not shorten the prayer during the prescribed travel distance is sinful</li>
                <li>It is forbidden to offer full prayer during the prescribed journey; Qasar is obligatory</li>
                <li>Some people feel guilty about shortening the prayer instead of offering the full prayer; this is incorrect</li>
                <li>During the prescribed journey, offering two rak'ahs instead of four is proven from the Qur'an and Hadith</li>
                <li>According to the Hanafi school, Qasar is mandatory for travelers, even if the journey is comfortable (e.g., by train); offering full prayer is not correct</li>
                <li>Whether there is fear or not during travel, in all cases Qasar should be performed</li>

                “All praise is for Allah. We praise Him, seek His help and forgiveness, and seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and our bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, none can misguide, and whomever He lets go astray, none can guide. We testify that there is no deity but Allah, He is One, has no partner, and we testify that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger. Allah sent him with truth as a bringer of good news and a warner before the Hour. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger is rightly guided, and whoever disobeys them harms only himself and does not harm Allah in the least. The best speech is the Book of Allah, and the best guidance is the way of Muhammad ﷺ. The worst matters are newly invented ones; every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance leads to Hell. May Allah bless us and you with the Noble Qur'an, and benefit us and you with verses and wise remembrance. Seek forgiveness from Him, truly He is the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”

We seek refuge in Him from the evils within ourselves and our bad deeds. Whomever Allah guides, none can misguide, and whomever He lets go astray, none can guide. We testify that there is no deity but Allah, He is One, has no partner, and we testify that our Master, Muhammad ﷺ, is Allah’s servant and Messenger. Allah sent him with truth as a bringer of good news and a warner. Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ. O believers! Send blessings and peace upon him. Allahumma swalli wa sallim wa baarik ala sayyidinaa Muhammad wa ala aalihi wa ashabihi wa atba'ihi ajmaeen until the Day of Judgment. Especially: Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman, Ali (may Allah be pleased with them), Hasan, Husain, their mother Fatima Zahra, his uncles Hamza and Abbas, the remaining four Sahabah among the ten promised Paradise, all Sahabah and Tabe'een (may Allah be pleased with them). May Allah forgive all believing men and women, Muslim men and women, living and deceased (Ameen). I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. Allah commands justice, excellence, giving to relatives, and forbids immorality, evil, and rebellion; He advises you so that you remember. Remember Allah, He will remember you; call upon Him, He will answer you; Allah's remembrance is the highest, most important, most complete, and greatest.”

If intending to stay more than 15 days, he is not considered a traveler but a resident and must offer full prayers. If the journey is less than 48 miles, he is not a traveler and must offer full prayers.</p>
    <p>During travel, Qasar is only for Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha prayers, i.e., four-rak'ah prayers are performed as half (two rak'ahs). Fajr and Maghrib remain unchanged, Witr is wajib and must be performed as three rak'ahs. Sunnah prayers, except for Fajr, are optional; Fajr's two rak'ahs Sunnah are necessary.

In the meaning of authentic Hadith, remembrance (zikr) purifies the heart, and one who remembers Allah among the heedless is like a lamp in a dark house. Therefore, we must be persistent in remembrance at home, in the shop, and while walking, to keep Allah in our thoughts. Our great religious elders have taught an easy method: daily, morning and evening, recite three tasbeehs regularly—third kalimah 100 times, Durood Shareef 100 times, and Istighfar 100 times.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Kalimah:</strong><br>
    "Sub-haa-nallaahi wal-hamdu lillaahi walaa ilaaha illal-laahu wallaahu akbar walaa haula walaa quwwata illaa billaa-hil aliyyil azeem"<br>
    سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَلَا إِلَهُ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ<br>
    وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيم
    </p>
    <p><strong>Durood Shareef:</strong><br>
    "Jazallaa-hu annaa muhammadam maa-huwa ahluhuu swallellaahu-alaihi wasallam"<br>
    جَزَى اللَّهُ عَنَّا مُحَمَّدًا مَّا هُوَ أَهْلُهُ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ
    </p>
    <p><strong>Istighfar:</strong><br>
    "As-tag-firul-laa-hallazii laa-ilaa-ha illaa huwal hayyul qayyumu wa-atoobu ilaih"<br>
    اسْتَغْفِرُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّوْمُ وَاتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ
    </p>
    <p><strong>Virtues:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>100 times "Subhaanallah": Reward of freeing 100 Arab slaves</li>
        <li>100 times "Alhamdulillah": Reward as if giving 100 Arab horses with gear for jihad</li>
        <li>100 times "Allahu Akbar": Reward as if sacrificing and accepted 100 camels</li>
        <li>100 times "Laa ilaaha illallah": The space between heaven and earth is filled with goodness</li>
        <li>100 times "Laa haula walaa quwwata illa billahil aliyil azeem": Protection from 99 diseases</li>
        <li>Durood Shareef once: 40 benefits—10 sins forgiven, 10 good deeds written, 10 ranks raised in Jannah, 10 mercies sent; with sincerity, recite Istighfar three times—even if sins are as much as the foam of the sea, Allah forgives them</li>

        title: "Etiquettes of Outreach (Gashth ke Adaab)",
        content: `<p>The practice of outreach (Gashth) is like the backbone of this religious work. If this is done with correct intentions, the invitation will be accepted, leading to acceptance of dua, which brings guidance. Four practices are essential for Gashth:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Going for general outreach (Umumi Gashth)</li>
        <li>Receiving newcomers (Isteqbaal)</li>
        <li>Conducting a middle discussion (Darmiyaani baath)</li>
        <li>Sitting for zikr and dua</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>General Outreach (Umumi Gashth):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximum 10 people, minimum 3: one guide, one speaker, one leader</li>
        <li>If the guide is local, it's better. The guide greets Muslims gently and humbly, introduces them to the speaker, and if a shop owner, brings him out to meet. The guide should meet shop and house owners in order</li>
        <li>The speaker greets, shakes hands, talks about faith and conviction, tries to bring them actively to the mosque; avoid making it an announcement or lengthy speech; if someone gives an excuse, leave politely</li>
        <li>The leader: upon leaving the mosque, prays, walks with the group, guide in front, speaker behind, leader at the end watching all, reminding with zikr and concern, and if someone is negligent, encourage remembrance; protect one's gaze, near home be mindful of privacy, and on return come back with regret and recite istighfar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Receiving (Isteqbaal):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep one or two companions at the mosque door, greet, ask about wellbeing, seat them in the religious gathering, if they haven't prayed, help with wudu and prayer, stay in remembrance and concern without idle talk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Middle Discussion (Darmiyaani baath):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather the rest, build the mindset of religion, speak about the virtues of Allah’s path, encourage intentions, after prayer encourage sitting and gathering others</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Zikr and Dua:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The soul of outreach is zikr and dua; sit one or two companions for zikr and dua, do some zikr, pray for success of the outreach work and guidance for the whole world; through dua and invitation, people receive guidance</li>

        title: "Six (6) Qualities (Che Sifaat)",
        content: `<p>All of mankind's success is in this blessed religion; whoever has religion in his life will succeed in this world and the Hereafter, and whoever does not have religion in his life will not succeed in this world or the Hereafter. By staying in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ), the companions (Razi Allahu Anhum) learned many qualities. Practicing some of these qualities will make following religion easier.</p>
    <p><strong>These qualities are:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Faith (Imaan)</li>
        <li>Prayer (Namaaz)</li>
        <li>Knowledge and Remembrance (Ilm wa Zikr)</li>
        <li>Respect for Muslims (Ikraame Muslim)</li>
        <li>Sincerity of intention (Ikhlaase Niyyath)</li>
        <li>Invitation and propagation (Daawath wa Tableeg)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These six qualities are not the complete religion, but without them there is no religion.</p>
    <h4>(1) Imaan (Faith):</h4>
    <p>The goal of Imaan is for our hearts to have the correct conviction, to have conviction in Allah alone, and to remove conviction in anything besides Allah. The meaning of Imaan reaches the mind, the letters of Imaan reach the book, the words of Imaan reach the tongue, the sound of Imaan reaches the ears, the sincerity of Imaan reaches the heart; by speaking, thinking, hearing, and walking against outward appearances, the reality of Imaan is achieved.</p>
    <p><strong>Kalima of Imaan:</strong><br>
    "Laa-ilaaha illal-laahu muhammadur Rasoo-lullaah" (swallellaahu-alaihi wasallam)<br>
    لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم<br>
    Meaning: There is no god but Allah; Muhammad (ﷺ) is Allah's Messenger.<br>
    The meaning: Nothing happens except by Allah, honor, disgrace, life, death, sickness, cure, day/night, sustenance, worry, love, hate—everything is in Allah's hands. There is 100% success in following the way of the Prophet (ﷺ). The requirement of the Kalima: leave a life of personal desire and adopt a life desired by the Lord.</p>
    <p>To bring Imaan into our lives, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings and listen to the virtues of Imaan, walk among people and call to Imaan, speak much about Allah's greatness</li>
        <li>Reflect deeply on Allah's creation</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for true Imaan</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(2) Namaaz (Prayer):</h4>
    <p>The goal is for our lives to become characteristic of prayer, meaning just as we fulfill Allah's command in prayer, we should fulfill Allah's command outside prayer as well. In the meaning of Hadith: Whoever offers five daily prayers regularly, Allah gives him five rewards:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Removes shortage of sustenance</li>
        <li>Removes punishment of the grave</li>
        <li>Gives the book of deeds in the right hand</li>
        <li>Lets one cross the bridge (Pul-Siraat) as quickly as lightning</li>
        <li>Protects from accounting</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Prayer is the coolness of the Prophet's (ﷺ) eyes, the light of the believer, it blackens the face of Satan, and it brings peace to the heart. Just as the head is essential for the body, prayer is essential for a Muslim.</p>
    <p>To develop true prayer, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of prayer, walk among people and call to true prayer and its virtues</li>
        <li>Practice two rak'ahs of voluntary prayer for both outward and inward aspects</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for true prayer</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(3) Ilm wa Zikr (Knowledge and Remembrance):</h4>
    <p>Knowledge is a path; remembrance is a light.</p>
    <p>The goal of knowledge is to develop a spirit of inquiry. At minimum, know enough to distinguish halal and haram. In the meaning of Hadith: Whoever goes out to learn religious knowledge, angels spread their wings for him, and fish, beasts, and birds pray for his forgiveness.</p>
    <p>To bring knowledge into our lives, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of religious knowledge, walk among people and call to its virtues</li>
        <li>Learn practical knowledge from reliable scholars, and virtues-related knowledge from religious books and educational circles</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for true knowledge</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The goal of remembrance is to develop mindfulness of Allah. In the meaning of Hadith: The one who remembers Allah is like a living person, and one who doesn't is like a dead person. Whoever keeps his tongue moist with remembrance will enter Paradise smiling.</p>
    <p>To bring remembrance into our lives, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of remembrance, walk among people and call to its virtues</li>
        <li>Sit alone and remember Allah, morning and evening recite three tasbeehs regularly, develop the feeling that Allah is in front of you, watching you, and listening to your remembrance</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for the reality of remembrance</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(4) Ikraame Muslim (Respect for Muslims):</h4>
    <p>Let the character of the Prophet (ﷺ) come into us; recognize your own rights while fulfilling the rights of others. In the meaning of Hadith: Whoever covers his brother's faults, Allah will cover his faults on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
    <p>To develop this quality, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of good manners, walk among people and invite to the manners, compassion, and sacrifice of the Prophet (ﷺ) and companions (Razi Allahu Anhum)</li>
        <li>Serve every companion to develop humility, look at every servant of Allah with love, consider oneself insignificant</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for the Prophet's (ﷺ) character</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(5) Ikhlaase Niyyath (Sincerity of Intention):</h4>
    <p>Do every good deed for the pleasure of Allah. Even a tiny good deed done for Allah’s pleasure will get the reward of Mount Uhud, but if a huge good deed is done for show, not even a mustard seed’s worth of reward will be given.</p>
    <p>Sign of sincerity: If someone praises you, don't be happy; if someone dislikes or breaks off, don't make them an enemy or seek revenge.</p>
    <p>To develop sincerity, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of sincerity, walk among people and invite to sincerity</li>
        <li>Before, during, and after every action, check your intention three times</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for true sincerity</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>(6) Daawath wa Tableeg (Invitation and Propagation):</h4>
    <p>Take the effort of this religion as your responsibility, and work with your life and wealth for the revival of religion worldwide. Qur'an meaning: Allah has purchased the lives and wealth of believers in exchange for Paradise. In the meaning of Hadith: Going out in Allah's path for a little while is better than the world and all its contents.</p>
    <p>To develop invitation and propagation, three lines of effort are needed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sit in religious gatherings, listen to the virtues of Allah's path, walk among people and invite to its virtues</li>
        <li>Wherever you go, take out groups for 4 months, 40 days, and 3 days, and suppress personal desires, go out regularly for 4 months, 40 days, and 3 days in Allah’s path</li>
        <li>Cry and ask Allah for the ability to go out in His path</li>

        <li>Women get the reward of jihad for performing Hajj</li>
        <li>The prayer of a pregnant woman is better than 80 rak'ahs of a regular woman; the prayer of a mother is better than 82 years of worship of a childless woman</li>

        <li>A righteous woman helps in religious work</li>
        <li>Wealth comes through inheritance, but a wise and righteous wife is not among worldly things but among the causes of the Hereafter</li>
        <li>An educated woman means the whole family is educated</li>

        <li>If a woman veils herself from non-mahram men and protects her honor in her husband's absence, the fire of Hell will not touch her</li>
        <li>If you have no shame, do whatever you wish</li>
        <li>A woman's voice is also considered part of her veiling, so she should not speak loudly before non-mahram men</li>
        <li>In Paradise, people will go to see Allah, but those women who observed veiling in the world, Allah Himself will show them His vision</li>
        <li>The best wealth for a man is a woman with good character—who protects her chastity, is kind to children, speaks gently</li>

        <li>If she is patient when her husband troubles her—reward like that of Hazrat Aasiya (may Allah be pleased with her)</li>
        <li>If husband and wife look at each other with love—Allah also looks at them with love</li>
        <li>If husband and wife sit and talk, joke and laugh—it is better than voluntary prayers</li>

        <li>If husband and wife perform ghusl after intimacy—reward of 4000 years of worship</li>
        <li>If a pregnant woman has a husband who is pleased with her—reward equal to the worship of a warrior day and night</li>
        <li>Every night of pregnancy counts as worship, every day counts as fasting</li>
        <li>If the child is miscarried—it will drag its mother into Paradise, so she should be patient</li>
        <li>If she dies during pregnancy, childbirth, or cleaning after childbirth—she attains the status of martyrdom</li>
        <li>For every pain during childbirth, the mother gets the reward of an accepted Hajj and freeing a slave</li>
